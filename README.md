# Hello

My name is Eleanor Susanto from Binus University and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 

First foremost, I would like to say thank you for giving me this opportunity to do the technical test for 99 Group Front End Developer Intern Position. I hope this surpass your expectation. 

To answer the question regarding main pic, I suggest to compress the picture online by searching compress image online. For example, TinyPNG or other picture compressing tools online. Not only that, I did find a way to change it offline, which is by using editing tools. Downloading and rendering it to a smaller size could belp with reducing weight. But I always do the compress image online method since it reduces a lot of the weight.

I have to admit that the test is pretty challenging since it's my first full-length React Project I have ever done, but I had so much fun and I found it very interesting! I also tried my best and hardest and learned so much from this test itself and I would be honored to learn more of it through 99 Group. I am looking foward to hear from you guys, Thank you so much once again.
